# flightbalance
FlightBalance is a simple application designed to let you perform weight and balance calculations for GA aircraft while simultaneously viewing the results. You can fine-tune aircraft profiles by adding load stations and envelope limits and calculations are viewed on a real-time chart.

This project was created as a prototype for the FlightBalance Android app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kristianseng.flightbalance
